# BIELIK CLI - CHANGELOG

## üéâ **Version 0.1.15 - MAJOR MILESTONE RELEASE**
*Date: September 21, 2025*

### üèÜ **CRITICAL OBJECTIVES COMPLETED**

#### ‚úÖ **Installation System Overhaul**
- **Fixed externally-managed Python environments support** (PEP 668)
- **Enhanced Docker container detection and handling**
- **Implemented robust virtual environment creation with fallback mechanisms**
- **Added proper pip installation flags for restricted environments** (`--break-system-packages`, `--user`)
- **Fixed `--skip-ai` flag functionality** by moving `llama-cpp-python` to optional dependencies
- **Created comprehensive installation logging and error handling**

#### ‚úÖ **Context Provider Commands System - FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- **Discovered and fixed root cause**: Commands needed to use command registry system, not content processor
- **Completely rewrote `execute_prompt` function** to properly detect and process both command types:
  - **CLI Commands** (`:calc`, `:pdf`) - Direct utility commands
  - **Context Provider Commands** (`folder:`) - Data analysis commands
- **All commands now work independently of AI models** - No llama-cpp-python required
- **Validated functionality**:
  - `folder: .` - Returns comprehensive directory analysis
  - `:calc 2 + 3 * 4` - Performs mathematical calculations (result: 14)
  - `:pdf test.txt` - Reads and processes document content

#### ‚úÖ **Docker Testing Framework**
- **Created `.dockerignore`** for optimized Docker builds (excludes virtual environments, cache files, IDE files)
- **Implemented multiplatform Docker testing** with Alpine Linux validation
- **Successful Alpine Linux installation** with Context Provider Commands working
- **Docker environment detection** and appropriate installation handling

#### ‚úÖ **Code Quality and Compatibility**
- **Fixed Python 3.11 compatibility issues** with TensorFlow/transformers imports
- **Resolved W293 style violations** by removing whitespace from blank lines in `image_analyzer.py`
- **Enhanced error handling** throughout the codebase
- **Improved logging and user feedback**

#### ‚úÖ **User Experience Improvements**
- **Updated CLI branding** to "Powered by HuggingFace + SpeakLeash"
- **Clear installation guidance** with proper next steps
- **Comprehensive help system** showing all available commands
- **Proper separation** of utility commands from AI features

## üöÄ **Technical Achievements**

### **Installation & Environment Management**
```bash
# Now works perfectly across all environments:
python3 install.py --skip-ai  # ‚úÖ Works in Docker, externally-managed Python, virtual environments
```

### **Command System Independence**
```bash
# All these work without AI models:
folder: .                    # ‚úÖ Directory analysis
:calc 2 + 3 * 4             # ‚úÖ Mathematical calculations  
:pdf document.txt           # ‚úÖ Document reading
```

### **Docker Multiplatform Support**
```bash
make docker-test-alpine     # ‚úÖ Successful installation and command validation
```
